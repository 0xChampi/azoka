          “Blockchain technology and meme coins have the potential to create a censorship-resistant platform for free expression. By leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain, it becomes difficult for any single entity to control or manipulate the information stored on the network. This can be particularly useful for individuals living under oppressive regimes, where traditional forms of communication and expression are often heavily monitored or restricted.”
